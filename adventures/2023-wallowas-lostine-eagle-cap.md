## Wallowas Bowman TH to Eagle Cap Peak (June 30 - July 3 2023)

Possibly the best trip to date. Views from Eagle Cap are incredible, and the alpine camping is unrivaled. Off the beaten trails there are few people.

### Strava Links

#### [Day 1: Bowman/Francis Trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/9374653664)

Lots of bugs at the camping near the intersection with N. Minam Trail.

#### [Day 2: N. Minam Trail run](https://www.strava.com/activities/9374653670) 

Heading North on N. Minam Trail it is very treed as of July 2023. Movement is slow. Definitely not runnable.

#### [Day 2: N. Minam Trail to Copper Creek Trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/9374704405) 

Beautiful camping near the intersection of these trails

#### [Day 3: Long Lake South Peak run](https://www.strava.com/activities/9376058203)

From the intersection of N Minam Trail and Copper Creek trail, this is a fun mostly runnable route with great views and a sandy dommed peak with three lookout points.

#### [Day 3: Horton Pass](https://www.strava.com/activities/9383444911)

Intersection of Copper Creek and N Minam Trail to Minam Lake Trail - Ivan Carper Trail, then traversing across from Ivan Carper Pass to Horton Pass. The traverse is probably not advisable in most snow conditions, but in July when snow is still on the slopes, it can be done without damaging non-trail terrain.

#### [Day 4: Eagle Cap Peak](https://www.strava.com/activities/9383810389)

Eagle Cap Peak is incredible and not a difficult ascent. Worth considering from Hurricane Creek as a day hike.

#### [Day 4: East Fork Lostine Trail to Bowman TH](https://www.strava.com/activities/9383810776)

The wide flat valley of the East Lostine is beautiful and probably fantastic backcountry skiing in the winter. Could establish bash camp near Mirror Lake.

__Is the pink snow a neurotoxin?__

Apparently [not](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-pink-snow-is-not-what-you-think-it-is-9651061/), but it may contain some things that aren't great for you and you shouldn't eat it.

__Can you hunt in wilderness areas?__

In general the only rules applicable to all wilderness areas are that [no motorized transport or commercial activities are allowed](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/wallowa-whitman/specialplaces/?cid=stelprdb5213889). This inludes bicycles.
