## Rawah Wilderness (Aug 11 - Aug 14, 2024)

One of the best adventures to date. We keep getting better at organizing and picking routes that are far enough away from mainstream to be mostly alone but not so outside the norm that we have to bushwack through terrible terrain a la the Blue Mountains trip in 2020(?).

Total volume was approximately 64 miles and about 16 hours.

### Activities
