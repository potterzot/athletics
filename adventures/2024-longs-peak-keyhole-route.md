## Longs Peak (Aug 17, 2024)

[Strava Link]

Reviews and descriptions are quite varied, suggesting needing to carry as much as 4L of water and taking as much as 10-15 hours. In truth, for reasonably fit ultra runners / hikers and with dry conditions, I'd estimate more like:

- 1.5L of water or less needed, depending on heat. We used 1-1.5L each and did not refill.
- Contrary to what you will read, there are two potential water sources, one about 2 miles in and another before keyhole. By bringing a filter you can get away with carrying even less water.
- 7-8 hours round trip, depending on conditions. Less if you run parts, more if there are a lot of people.
- Our times were roughly: 2:40 to get to keyhole, 1:00 to get to the peak, 1:00 to get back to keyhole, and 2:20 to get back to the vehicle. We were parked down the road so if parked at the TH this would be ~20 minutes less.

Of course conditions make the trip, particularly on this route. Wet rock, ice, inclement weather, etc would all slow things down.

We left the vehicle at 4:45AM, and there were already cars parked well down the road from the TH. We were back before noon.
