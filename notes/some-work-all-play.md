### Episode 126: The Norwegian Model
- Reference (this article](https://www.mariusbakken.com/the-norwegian-model.html) by Dr. Bakken
- The reference to specific lactate measures is not helpful for most of us. For reference, 2ml is typically associated with the aerobic threshold (Z2/Z3 line) while 4ml is associated with lactate threshold (Z3/Z4 line), i.e. the effort you could run at for 50-60 minutes. 
- The point being, it might be good to train double threshold days, where thresholds are mostly at the 2.5 and 3.5ml level, which probably corresponds to something like marathon pace and half marathon pace. If your AeT is 140 and your AnT is 160, then this would be about 145HR and 155HR, which should correspond roughly to starting HR at M and HM pace.
- A schedule might look like:
  - MO: AM 10km | PM 10km w/ drills, 6x30s/90s strides
  - TU: AM 5x6min/1min @ MP | PM 10x1km/1min @ HMP
  - WE: AM 10km | PM Strength work
  - TH: AM 5x2km/1min @ MP | PM 25x400/30s @ HMP
  - FR: AM 10km
  - SA: AM Hill run 20x200m/70s @ 10k-5k effort | PM 10km
  - SU: AM 20km | PM Strength work

### Favorite workouts
- Diagonals: run the diagonal, jog the goal line
- Hill Beast: 10,8,6,4,2 min hill repeats, jog down; or on flats
- Power Hour: Start at MP, cut down each mile to 10k pace. Finish hands on knees; or Power Half-Hour at HMP to 5k
- Tempo-Intervals combo: 15,10,5 min @LT with 5min float recovery and then 1min/5min fartleks @5k for the rest in a long run
- 8-12x90s w/ 60s @10k-5k, 30s @5k-3k
- 5-10x3min intervals @10k float MP
