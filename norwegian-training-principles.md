## A summary of "Norwegian" training principles

These notes are garnered from a [post](https://www.mariusbakken.com/the-norwegian-model.html) by Marius Bakken, episode #126 of the [Some Work All Play](https://swaprunning.com/), and various reddit and letsrun.com threads.

The basic idea is to focus on paces from marathon to lactate threshold pace, with double threshold days and only one higher effort workout each week. Work efforts are in a 6:1, 3:1, or 2:1 work/recovery ratio, with longer intervals being at a slower pace and shorter intervals being faster. So that looks something like:

- 5-6x(6'/1') at marathon pace or slightly faster (corresponding to 2.5mmol lacate)
- 10x(3'/1') at half-marathon to sub-lactate threshold pace (corresponding to 3.5mmol lactate)
- 20x(1'/30s) at sub-lactate threshold pace

These are arranged in two double threshold days, with a layout that looks something like (easy days are not included):

- Tue AM: 5x(6'/1') at M pace
- Tue PM: 10x(3'/1') at HM to LT pace
- Thu AM: 5x(6'/1') at M pace
- Thu PM: 20x(1'/30s) at LT pace
- Sat AM: 20x200m hill sprints at 5k effort or harder
- Sun AM: Long run

Some open questions remain that I'm not sure of, echoing what others have asked:

- For runners who do not have a speed base, is this approach as effective as a focus on CV or VO2Max training would be? It's possible that, for a non-trained runner, it might make sense to spend 12 weeks training speed and then 12 weeks following this threshold approach, rather than say 24 weeks focusing on threshold.
- For marathon distance events, Bakken suggests that intervals should be generally longer rather than shorter, with thresholds be more constant, say 10' or 20' intervals.
